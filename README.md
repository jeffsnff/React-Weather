# React-Weather

## About Weather React Website
I built this website to practice the skills I have relearned following along the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course. I just got done with Part 2 of the course and I wanted to practice the skills of consuming and API and displaying that information. The API I chose to use was [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

In order to use this API and use this site ( if you so choose to FORK it, but why would you do that ), you will need to setup an a a few things. 
1. Create an account for Weather API
2. Create a TOKEN so you can use the API
3. Create a .env file
4. Create a varialble in there following the Vite .env variable flow ( it is different from standard React.js )
5. Bring that .env into the file doing the API call.


# React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
